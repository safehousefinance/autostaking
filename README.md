SAFI Protocol is shortened form of Automatic Financial, a protocol that provides a decentralized financial asset which rewards users with a sustainable fixed compound interest up to 480,419.00% for the first 12 months. SAFI focused on DeFi innovation that creates benefits and value for SAFI token holders. Here are some benefits for holders of $SAFI:

- Low Risk with the SAFI Insurance - 5% of all trading fees are stored in The SAFI Insurance which helps sustain and back the staking rewards by maintaining price stability and greatly reducing downside risk.
- Easy and Safe Staking - The SAFI token always stays in your wallet so it doesn’t need to be put into the hands of a 3rd party or centralized authority. All you need to do is buy & hold as you automatically receive rewards in your own wallet so there’s no more complicated staking processes at all.
- Interest Yield with Automatic Payments - You need not be worry about having to re-stake your tokens. Interest yield is paid automatically and compounded in your own wallet, guaranteeing you will never miss a payment.
- Highest Fixed APY - SAFI pays out at 480,419.00% in the first 12 months which rivals anything in the DeFi arena to date. After the first 12 months the interest rate drops over an Epoch.
- Rapid Interest Payments - The SAFI Protocol pays every SAFI Token holder each and every 10 minutes or 144 times each day, making it the fastest auto-compounding protocol in crypto.
- Auto Token Burn - One of the exciting features of the SAFI Protocol is an automatic token burn system named “The SAFI Fireplace” which prevents circulating supply getting out of hand and becoming unmanageable. The Fireplace burns 2.5% out of all SAFI Token market sales and is burned in the same individual transaction.
